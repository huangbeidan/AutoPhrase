The request would have authorized an additional $173.8 billion designated as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds, of which $97.9 billion was requested for base programs. As enacted, the FY2020 NDAA authorizes a total of $729.9 billion for national defense-related activities, which is $12.0 billion (1.6%) less than the Administration requested.

Enacted annually to cover every defense budget since FY1962, the NDAA authorizes funding for the Department of Defense (DOD) activities at the same level of detail at which budget authority is provided by the corresponding defense, military construction, and other appropriations bills. While the NDAA does not provide budget authority, historically it has provided a fairly reliable indicator of congressional sentiment on funding for particular programs. The bill also incorporates provisions of law governing military compensation, the DOD acquisition process, and aspects of DOD policy toward other countries, among other subjects. Of the $761.8 billion requested by the Trump Administration for National Defense-related activities in FY2020, $750.0 billion is discretionary spending, of which approximately $741.9 billion falls within the scope of the annual NDAA. This includes $718.4 billion for DOD operations and $23.2 billion for defense-related work by the Energy Department involving nuclear energy, mostly related to nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants for warships. Other funding for defense-related activities, such as counter-intelligence work of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), falls mostly under the jurisdiction of other congressional committees.1 (See Figure 1.) 1 The NDAA also authorizes funding the Maritime Security Program of the Department of Transportation, for which the Trump Administration requested $300 million in FY2020. FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act: H.R. 2500, S. 1790 Congressional Research Service 2 Figure 1.

Note: Amounts may not sum due to rounding. The following overview reviews the strategic and budgetary context within which Congress debated the FY2020 NDAA. Subsequent sections of the report summarize the bill’s treatment of major components of the Trump Administration’s FY2020 budget request as well as provisions attached to the final bill that deal with other issues. FY2020 NDAA Overview As enacted, the FY2020 NDAA authorizes a total of $729.9 billion for national defense-related activities, which is $12.0 billion (1.6%) less than the Administration requested. The request included $568.1 billion to be designated as base budget funds to cover the routine, recurring costs to man, train, and operate U.S. forces. The request also included an additional $173.8 billion to be designated as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds to cover costs associated with the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and other activities. FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act: H.R. 2500, S. 1790 Congressional Research Service 3 OCO-designated funds are exempt from the binding caps on defense spending set by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-25) and the Administration’s request included $97.7 billion to be designated as OCO funding but intended to pay base budget expenses.

Notes: The column labeled “FY2020 Request” displays the Administration’s request as presented to Congress, which included $97.9 billion intended for base budget purposes but designated as OCO funding (in order to skirt binding caps on defense spending). The House and Senate Armed Services Committees each treated those amounts as part of the base budget request, as shown in the column labelled “FY2020 Request (adjusted).” The Senate Armed Services Committee reported its version of the FY2020 NDAA (S. 1790, S.Rept. 116-48) on June 11, 2019 and the Senate passed the bill on June 27, 2019. The House Armed Services Committee (HASC) reported its version (H.R. 2500, H.Rept. 116-120) on June 19, 2019 and the House passed the bill on July 12, 2019. On September 17, 2019, the House took up the Senate-passed S. 1790, amended it by eliminating the Senate-passed provisions and replacing them with the provisions of the House-passed H.R. 2500, and then passed the amended bill by voice vote. House and Senate conferees worked to produce a conference version of S. 1790. The conference report (H.Rept. 116-333) was agreed to by the House on December 11, 2019 by a vote of 377-48 and agreed to by the Senate on December 17, 2019 by a vote of 86-8. (Table 2.)

The final version of the bill agreed to by House and Senate conferees was an amended version S. 1790. Strategic Context According to the Administration, the FY2020 budget request for DOD reflects a shift in strategic emphasis based on the 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS), which called for “increased and sustained investment” to counter evolving threats from China and Russia. This would mark a change from the focus of U.S. national security policy for nearly the past three decades and a renewed emphasis on competition between nuclear-armed superpowers, which had been the cornerstone of U.S. strategy for more than four decades after the end of World War II. During the Cold War, U.S. national security policy and the design of the U.S. military establishment were strategically focused on competing with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and containing the global spread of communism. In the years following the collapse of the Soviet Union, U.S. policies were designed—and U.S. forces were trained and equipped—largely with a focus on dealing with potential regional aggressors such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea and on recalibrating relations with China and Russia. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. national security policy and DOD planning focused largely on countering terrorism and insurgencies in the Middle East while containing, if not reversing, North Korean and Iranian nuclear weapons programs. However, as a legacy of the Cold War, U.S. and allied military forces had overwhelming military superiority over these adversaries and, accordingly, operations were conducted in relatively permissive environments. The 2014 Russian invasion of the Crimean peninsula and subsequent proxy war in eastern Ukraine fostered a renewed concern in the United States and Europe about an aggressive and revanchist regime in Moscow. Meanwhile, China began building and militarizing islands in the South China Sea in order to lay claim to key shipping lanes. Together, these events highlighted anew the salience in the U.S. national security agenda of dealing with other great powers, that is, states able and willing to use military force unilaterally to accomplish their objectives. At the same time, the challenges that had surfaced at the end of the Cold War—fragile states, genocide, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation, to name a few—remained serious threats to U.S. interests. In some cases, adversaries appear to be collaborating to achieve shared or compatible objectives and to take advantage of social and economic tools to advance their agendas. Some states are also collaborating with non-state proxies (including, but not limited to, militias, criminal networks, corporations, and hackers) and deliberately blurring the lines between conventional and irregular conflict and between civilian and military activities. In this complex security environment, it is arguably more difficult than in past eras to manage these myriad problems. FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act: H.R. 2500, S. 1790 Congressional Research Service 5 The Trump Administration's December 2017 National Security Strategy (NSS),2 the 11-page unclassified summary of the January 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS),3 and the 2019 National Intelligence Strategy4 explicitly reorient U.S. national security strategy (including defense strategy) toward a primary focus on great power competition with China and Russia and on countering their military capabilities. In addition to explicitly making the great power competition the primary U.S. national security concern, the NDS also argues for a focus on bolstering the competitive advantage of U.S. forces, which, the document contends, has eroded in recent decades vis-à-vis the Chinese and Russian threats. The NDS also maintains that, contrary to what was the case for most of the years since the end of the Cold War, U.S. forces now must assume that their ability to approach military objectives will be vigorously contested. The Trump Administration’s strategic orientation as laid out in the NSS and NDA is consistent with the strategy outlined in comparable documents issued by prior Administrations, in identifying five significant external threats to U.S. interests: China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and terrorist groups with global reach. In a break from previous Administrations, however, the NDS views retaining the U.S. strategic competitive edge relative to China and Russia as a higher priority than countering violent extremist organizations. Accordingly, the new orientation for U.S. strategy is sometimes referred to a “2+3” strategy, meaning a strategy for countering two primary challenges (China and Russia) and three additional challenges (North Korea, Iran, and terrorist groups). 2018 National Defense Strategy: Focus on Great Power Competition For additional background and analysis on the National Defense Strategy, see CRS Report R45349, The 2018 National Defense Strategy: Fact Sheet, by Kathleen J. McInnis.

Budgetary Context In the four decades since the end of U.S. military involvement in Vietnam, annual outlays by the federal government have increased by a factor of nine. The fastest growing segment of federal spending during that period has been mandatory spending for entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. (See Figure 2.) 2 Office of the President, National Security Strategy of the United States, December 2017. https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905-2.pdf. 3 Department of Defense, Summary of the 2018 National Defense Strategy of the United States of America, January 2018, https://dod.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2018-National-Defense-Strategy-Summary.pdf. 4 Office of the Director of National Intelligence, January 2019, https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/National_Intelligence_Strategy_2019.pdf. FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act: H.R. 2500, S. 1790 Congressional Research Service 6 Figure 2. Outlays by Budget Enforcement Category, FY2001-FY2029 ($ in trillions) Source: Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Historical Tables, Table 8.1, Outlays by Budget Enforcement Act Category: 1962-2024; Congressional Budget Office (CBO), The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028 and the data supplement 10-Year Budget Projections from January 2019. Notes: Data from FY2001 through FY2019 from OMB; projections from FY2020 through FY2029 from CBO. The Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011 (P.L. 112-25) was intended to reduce spending by $2.1 trillion over the period FY2012-FY2021, compared to projected spending over that period. One element of the act established binding annual limits (or caps) to reduce discretionary federal spending through FY2021 by $1.0 trillion. Separate annual caps on discretionary appropriations for defense-related activities and nondefense activities are enforced by a mechanism called sequestration. Sequestration provides for the automatic cancellation of previous appropriations, to reduce discretionary spending to the BCA cap for the year in question. The caps on defense-related spending apply to discretionary funding for DOD and for defense-related activities of other agencies, comprising the national defense budget function which is designated budget function 050. The Budget Control Act For additional information on the BCA and its impact on the defense budget see CRS Report R44039, The Defense Budget and the Budget Control Act: Frequently Asked Questions, by Brendan W. McGarry; and CRS Report R42972, Sequestration as a Budget Enforcement Process: Frequently Asked Questions, by Megan S. Lynch. Compliance with the BCA defense caps would have required DOD to reduce its planned spending by tens of billions of dollars per year through FY2021. Congress repeatedly has raised the annual FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act: H.R. 2500, S. 1790 Congressional Research Service 7 spending caps to reduce their impact on projected spending. Nevertheless, the defense cap in effect when the Trump Administration submitted its FY2020 budget request was $576 billion—$97.9 billion less than the Administration requested for base budget spending. To avoid breaking that cap, the Administration designated as OCO funding a total of $97.9 billion to fund base budget activities. In marking up their respective versions of the FY2020 NDAA, the Armed Services Committees of the House and Senate each treated those funds as part of the base budget. The issue became moot after the defense spending cap was raised by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-37), enacted on August 2, 2019. Long-term Trends The total FY2020 DOD request—including both base budget and OCO funding—continued an upswing that began with the FY2016 budget, which marked the end of a relatively steady decline in real (that is, inflation-adjusted) DOD purchasing power. Measured in constant dollars, DOD funding peaked in FY2010, after which the drawdown of U.S. troops in OCO operations drove a reduction in DOD spending. (Figure 3.) Figure 3.

FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act: H.R. 2500, S. 1790 Congressional Research Service 8 Selected Authorization Issues Military Personnel Issues The enacted version of the FY2020 NDAA – like the House and Senate versions of the bill -- approves the Administration’s proposal for a relatively modest net increase in the number of active-duty military personnel. It also authorizes the Administration’s proposed reduction in the end-strength of the Selected Reserve—those members of the military reserve components and the National Guard who are organized into operational units that routinely drill, usually on a monthly basis. (Table 3.) Military Personnel Issues For information and additional analysis concerning military personnel issues dealt with in the FY2020 NDAA, see CRS Report R46107, FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act: Selected Military Personnel Issues, coordinated by Bryce H.

Note: In addition to the National Guard and the reserve components of the armed forces, the Selected Reserve includes the 7,000 members of the Coast Guard Reserve. Basic Pay Increase5 Section 609 of the enacted FY2020 NDAA authorizes a 3.1% increase in military basic pay, as was requested by the Administration. It is the same increase that would have occurred if neither Congress nor the President had taken any action on the subject. By law,6 military personnel 5 For additional background, see CRS In Focus IF10260, Defense Primer: Military Pay Raise, by Lawrence Kapp. 6 10 U.S.C. 1009. FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act: H.R. 2500, S. 1790 Congressional Research Service 9 receive an annual increase in basic pay that is indexed to the annual increase in the Labor Department’s Employment Cost Index (ECI) unless either (1) Congress passes a law to provide otherwise; or (2) the President specifies an alternative pay adjustment. The initial Senate version of the NDAA was silent regarding the pay raise. The initial House version of the bill would have:  Mandated a 3.1% raise (Section 606); and  Authorized the same 3.1% raise, even if the President had specified a different increase (Section 607). This provision was not included in the final version of the bill. “Widows’ Tax”7 Following the death of a servicemember, certain beneficiaries may be eligible for survivor benefits from both DOD (under the Survivors Benefit Program or SBP) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (under the Dependency and Indemnity Compensation or DIC). However, by law, surviving spouses who receive both annuities must have their SBP payments reduced by the amount of DIC they receive.8 Critics refer to this offset as a widows' tax. Section 622 of the enacted version of the FY2020 NDAA phases out the DIC offset requirement over a period of three years. Section 630A of the initial House-passed version would have repealed the offset, outright. The initial Senate-passed version was silent on the issue. Ban on Transgender Military Personnel A DOD policy adopted on April 12, 2019, prohibits entry into military service of any person who identifies as transgender. The policy allows transgender individuals to apply for a waiver of that prohibition. The enacted version of the bill does not challenge the Administration’s policy. However, Section 596 of the NDAA conference report requires DOD to report on the number of requested waivers to the transgender ban that have been denied. Section 596 of the House-passed version of the bill would have established a similar reporting requirement. Section 530B of the House-passed version of the bill, which was not included in the conference report, would have nullified the transgender ban, extending to gender identity the same legal protection against discrimination that current law provides for race and sex. The Senate version of the NDAA contained no provisions relevant to this issue. Military Medical Malpractice9 Section 731 of the NDAA conference report authorizes the Secretary of Defense to pay a claim for the death or personal injury of a servicemember resulting from medical malpractice by a DOD 7 For additional background, see CRS Legal Sidebar LSB10316, Eliminating the SBP-DIC Offset for Surviving Spouses of Military Servicemembers: Current Proposals and Related Issues, by Mainon A. Schwartz. 8 10 U.S.C. §1450(c). 9 For additional background, see CRS In Focus IF11102, Military Medical Malpractice and the Feres Doctrine, by Bryce H. P. Mendez and Kevin M. Lewis and CRS Legal Sidebar LSB10305, The Feres Doctrine: Congress, the Courts, and Military Servicemember Lawsuits Against the United States, by Kevin M. Lewis. FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act: H.R. 2500, S. 1790 Congressional Research Service 10 health care provider. This addresses a legal doctrine rooted in the Supreme Court’s 1950 ruling, in the case of Feres v. United States, that the federal government is immunized from liability “for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.”10 Many lower federal courts have concluded that this principle, known as the Feres doctrine, generally prohibits military servicemembers from asserting malpractice claims against the United States based on the negligent actions of health care providers employed by the military. Section 729 of the House version of the NDAA bill would have overturned the Feres doctrine by amending the Federal Tort Claims Act to allow servicemembers to pursue tort claims against the United States for medical malpractice committed by health care provider in a Military Treatment Facility (MTF). The Senate bill had no provision covering this subject. Strategic Nuclear-armed Systems In general, the conference report on the FY2020 NDAA supported the Trump Administration’s budget request for nuclear and other long-range strike weapons. This program continues an across the board modernization of the nuclear triad: ballistic missile-launching submarines, long-range bombers, and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). However, the Trump program also included proposals to diversify the arsenal of nuclear weapons that the triad might deliver. The conference report did not include provisions of the House version of the bill that would have limited some of those efforts.

According to unclassified sources,11 each of the several W-76 warheads currently carried by a single Trident II currently has an explosive power (or yield) approximately equal to that of 100 thousand tons of TNT (100 kilotons). The intended yield of the new “low-yield” warhead is reported to be about 10 kilotons. The atomic weapons detonated at Hiroshima and Nagasaki were roughly 15 kilotons and 20 kilotons, respectively.12 As requested, the enacted NDAA authorizes $10 million in the Energy Department’s national security budget to modify existing warheads and $19.6 million to install them in deployed missiles. The Trump Administration contends that a low-yield warhead would discourage potential adversaries from thinking that, if they used relatively small nuclear weapons in a regional conflict, the United States would shrink from retaliating (or threatening to respond) if the only nuclear weapons at its disposal were the considerably more destructive warheads currently in the U.S. arsenal. Critics of the proposal contend that deployment of new, low-yield weapons could increase the risk of nuclear war by making it easier for U.S. officials to consider their use in a limited conflict. Low-Yield Nuclear Warhead Debate For background and additional analysis, see CRS In Focus IF11143, A Low-Yield, Submarine-Launched Nuclear Warhead: Overview of the Expert Debate, by Amy F. Woolf. The House bill would have denied all funds requested for the program and included a provision (Section 1646) that would have barred the use of any funds for this purpose. A floor amendment to strike this provision was rejected by the House on a near-party-line vote of 201-221. The provision was not included in the enacted bill. 11 Union of Concerned Scientists, Fact Sheet: The New, ‘Low-Yield’, Submarine-based Nuclear Warhead,” accessed at https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2018/11/W76-2-fact-sheet.pdf. 12 The actual yield of the W76-2 reportedly is lower than the World War II-era bombs, but the precise yield is classified. FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act: H.R. 2500, S. 1790 Congressional Research Service 12 ICBMs and Warheads As enacted, the FY2020 NDAA authorizes more than 97% of the $682.4 million requested to develop a fleet of new ICBMs to replace the 400 Minuteman missiles currently deployed in silos located in Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming. This total includes $552.4 million of the $570.4 million requested to continue development of the new missile, designated the Ground Based Strategic Defense (GBSD). It also includes, in the Energy Department’s national security budget, $112.0 million – the entire amount requested -- to develop a new warhead (designated W87-1) to equip the new missile, in lieu of the W78 warhead carried by the Minuteman. Section 1672 of the enacted bill prohibits any reduction in the number of deployed U.S. ICBMs, currently 400 missiles. The Senate version of the bill would have authorized $22 million more than was requested for GBSD. Section 1664 of the Senate bill would have prohibited any reduction in the number of ICBMs The House bill would have imposed a reduction of $140.0 million on the $682.4 million request for R&D related to a new ICBM—a cut of about 20%. This included a net reduction of $81.0 million for GBSD13 and a reduction of $59.0 million for the warhead. The House rejected by a vote of 164-264 an amendment to the House version of the bill that would have delayed the GBSD program and required an independent study of options to extend the service life of the currently deployed Minuteman missiles. Nuclear Warhead “Pits”14 The NDAA conference report authorizes $712.4 million as requested to continue expanding the Energy Department’s capacity for manufacturing so-called plutonium pits – the nuclear triggers that initiate the explosion of a thermonuclear bomb or missile warhead. This includes $241.1 million to begin construction of a new pit production facility at the Energy Department’s Savannah River Site, near Aiken, GA. The new facility would put the Energy Department on track to meet a goal of being able to produce 80 pits per year by 2030, a goal set the by Trump Administration in 2018. The House bill would have denied authorization of the $241.1 million requested for the Savanah River facility. Section 3114 of the House bill would have repealed a provision of law that codifies the 80 pit per year goal. Long-range, Precision Strike Weapons In general, the NDAA conference report support’s the Administration requests to expand the U.S. arsenal of guided missiles that could accurately strike targets at ranges of 100 miles and more with conventional (that is, nonnuclear) warheads. (Table 5.) As U.S. strategy has focused more sharply on Russia and China as potential adversaries, DOD has placed increasing emphasis on developing such weapons, partly because those two countries are developing defenses intended to keep U.S. forces at a distance. 13 This reflects a cut of $103.0 million to the missile development effort partly offset by an addition of $22.0 million for command and control improvements. 14 For additional background, see CRS Report R44442, Energy and Water Development Appropriations: Nuclear Weapons Activities, by Amy F.

Space Programs and Organization The enacted version of the FY2020 NDAA authorizes the bulk of the Administration’s $14.1 billion request for National Security Space operations, which includes funds for DOD’s satellite acquisition, space launches, and other space-oriented activities.15 The requested amount is 17% higher than the amount appropriated for these activities in FY2019—a rate of increase more than triple the Administration’s proposed 4.9% increase in the overall DOD budget.16 FY2020 National Security Space Budget Request 15 National Security Space is one of the twelve Major Force Programs (MFPs) into which DOD categorizes all of its activities. Creation of the National Security Space MFP (designated MFP 12) was mandated by the FY2016 NDAA (P.L. 114-92). In general, each MFP aggregates all the funding, manpower, and organizations associated with a particular set of missions. However—as of the submission of the FY2020 budget request—MFP 12 does not include funding for military personnel associated with DOD space activities nor funding for space activities associated with certain intelligence agencies including the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency and the National Reconnaissance Office. 16 General John W.

McCall and Brendan W. McGarry. The final bill authorizes most of the funds requested for DOD’s most expensive acquisition programs for space systems, as the House and Senate versions would have done.

Space Force As proposed by the Administration, the FY2020 NDAA establishes the U.S. Space Force as a separate armed service within the Department of the Air Force (a status analogous to that of the Marine Corps as a separate service within the Department of the Navy). The bill authorizes $72.4 million, as requested, to fund operation of the new organization. The new organization is to be headed by a four-star general (designated Chief of Space Operations) who is to report directly to the Secretary of the Air Force. After one year, that officer is to become a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), in which capacity he or she may provide advice to the President, without going through the Air Force chain of command, after first informing the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Similarly, as a member of the JCS, the Chief of Space Operations may make recommendations to Congress, after informing the Secretary of Defense. The enacted NDAA authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to transfer into the new organization all military personnel currently assigned to the Air Force Space Command and other Air Force military personnel. The Administration had proposed transferring into the Space Force personnel currently assigned to all of DOD’s space-oriented organizations. The earlier House and Senate versions of the FY2020 NDAA each would have approved some elements of the proposed consolidation, though neither bill would have afforded the new space FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act: H.R. 2500, S. 1790 Congressional Research Service 15 organization the degree of bureaucratic independence that the Administration proposed. The Senate bill would have authorized the requested $72.4 million for a Space Force within the Air Force to be overseen by a less senior civilian political appointee (an assistant secretary rather than an undersecretary). The House bill would have authorized $15.0 million for the new organization, which would have been designated a Space Corps and which would have had no civilian political overseer. Space Force For additional information and analysis, see CRS In Focus IF11326, Military Space Reform: FY2020 NDAA Legislative Proposals, by Stephen M. McCall, and CRS In Focus IF11203, Proposed Civilian Personnel System Supporting “Space Force,” by Alan Ott. Ballistic Missile Defense The enacted FY2020 NDAA approves the broad thrusts – and most of the details— of the Administration’s FY2020 anti-missile defense budget request. The request reflected the results of the Administration’s Missile Defense Review, published in January 2019. That study reaffirmed ongoing DOD efforts to (1) expand and improve a network of interceptor missiles that could protect U.S. territory against a relatively small number of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and (2) deploy systems to defense U.S. allies and U.S. forces stationed abroad against attack by missiles of shorter range.17(Table 7.) Many of the enacted bill’s differences with the budget request were linked to delays in the development of a more reliable warhead, designated the Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV), to be carried by the homeland defense system’s interceptor missiles. On August 21, 2019, after the House and Senate each had passed their respective versions of the FY2020 NDAA, DOD cancelled the RKV project.

New Interceptor Missile and Additional Radars The enacted bill authorizes a total of $602.7 million of the $843.8 million requested to develop an improved missile defense for U.S. territory that would include a new interceptor missile carrying the planned new warhead (RKV). The largest component of the net reduction from the request is a transfer of $140.0 million, associated with the RKV project, to develop improvements to the currently deployed homeland defense system. The bill also authorizes $173.4 million ($101.0 million less than requested) for development work on a new radar to be located in Hawaii. The House bill would have authorized $150.0 million less than requested for development of the new interceptor. The Senate bill would have authorized the amount requested. Aegis vs. ICBM18 The enacted bill authorizes a total of $53.8 million, distributed over several funding lines, to test the Navy’s Standard missile against an ICBM. The Standard, which is part of the Navy’s Aegis anti-missile system, was designed to intercept missiles of shorter range than ICBMs. However, new versions of the Standard theoretically would be capable of ICBM intercepts. Section 1680 of the FY2018 NDAA (P.L. 115-91) directed DOD to conduct a test of Aegis against an ICBM-range target. The House version of the bill would have eliminated the planned ICBM intercept test of Aegis, authorizing $12.1 million of the amount requested. 18 For background, and analysis, see CRS Report RL33745, Navy Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Program: Background and Issues for Congress, by Ronald O'Rourke. FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act: H.R. 2500, S. 1790 Congressional Research Service 17 Ground Combat Systems The Army presented its FY2020 budget request for weapons acquisition as “a bold shift”19 intended to place greater emphasis on shaping the force to deal with potential threats from Russia and China, as called for by the Administration’s FY2018 National Defense Strategy. Compared with the five-year defense plan (FYDP) that had accompanied the Army’s FY2019 budget request, the FY2020 FYDP would reduce previously planned spending for many systems currently in production to make funds available for accelerated development of successor weapons, better adapted to the newly emphasized “peer competitors.”20 The enacted version of the FY2020 NDAA largely supported the Army’s revised spending plans for ground combat vehicles, anti-aircraft defenses, and long-range precision strike weapons. The versions passed initially by the House and Senate would have done likewise.21 (See Table 8.) Army Modernization Plans For additional background on the Army’s modernization plans, see CRS Report R45519, The Army’s Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) Program: Background and Issues for Congress, by Andrew Feickert.

Notes: The Appendix lists the full citation of each CRS Report cited in this table by its ID number. Anti-Aircraft Defense The Army’s modernization plan would reconstitute the service’s short-range anti-aircraft defenses which had atrophied after the Soviet Union collapsed and DOD focused on counter-terrorism and related missions in the aftermath of 9/11. In this period, the Patriot missile—designed in the 1970s to intercept aircraft—was adapted to intercept long-range ballistic missiles as the shortest-range component of a layered defense. Since the turn of the century, DOD has focused more attention on other types of aerial threats which (because of their relatively short range or for other reasons) would challenge or thwart existing U.S. anti-missile/anti-aircraft defenses. These threats include unguided, short-range rockets and mortar shells used by insurgents; swarms of relatively small, armed drone aircraft; and technologically sophisticated cruise missiles, such as are deployed by Russia and China. The conference report on the bill – like the House and Senate versions – generally support this renewed focus on anti-aircraft defense, which includes:  M-SHORAD (Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense), a variant of the Stryker combat vehicle equipped with and array of guns and guided missiles to protect maneuvering combat units against aerial threats; and  IFPC (Indirect Fire Protection Capability), an array of sensors, missile launchers and various types of missiles to protect fixed sites. Naval Forces The Navy’s $23.8 billion shipbuilding budget request for FY2020 reflects a 2016 plan to increase the size of the fleet to 355 ships, a target some 15% higher than the force goal set by the previous Navy plan. The enacted version of the FY2020 NDAA – like the versions of the bill passed by the House and the Senate – generally supports the Navy program. The House-passed bill would have cut a total of $1.6 billion from the shipbuilding request, most of which the House Armed Services Committee justified as reflecting “excess cost growth.” (See Table 9.)

Notes: The Appendix lists the full citation of each CRS Report cited in this table by its ID number. Aircraft Carrier Funding As enacted, the NDAA authorized the $2.35 billion requested for construction of two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. The funding will be split between two carriers—costing roughly $12 billion apiece—for which a contract was signed in January 2019. One of the ships is slated for delivery to the Navy in 2028 and the other in 2032. FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act: H.R. 2500, S. 1790 Congressional Research Service 20 As a general rule, Congress requires DOD to budget for the entire cost of any weapon in a single year, with limited exceptions. However, in the case of certain high-priced items, such as carriers, Congress allows DOD to use incremental funding—spreading the cost of a ship or other item across the budgets of several fiscal years.22 Unmanned Surface and Undersea Vessels23 The enacted FY2020 NDAA would rein in spending on the Navy’s plan to speed development of several types of relatively large, unmanned surface ships and submarines that could supplement the current force by distributing its firepower and sensor network across a larger number of platforms. The FY2020 budget request includes a total of $628.8 million to develop these items, of which more than half—$372.5 million—is to jump-start the acquisition of Large Unmanned Surface Vehicles (LUSVs), based on commercial ship designs and able to carry modular payloads including various types of anti-ship and land attack missiles. Reportedly, the Navy envisions LUSVs as being as long as 300 feet in length and displacing 2,000 tons, in which case they would be roughly half the size of the Perry-class missile frigates the Navy used in the 1980s and 1990s.24 The conference report on the FY2020 NDAA authorizes the full amounts requested to develop a smaller unmanned surface vessel (designated MUSV) and a relatively large robot submarine with a payload volume of up to 2,000 cubic feet. However, it authorizes $196.5 million—slightly more than half the request—for the LUSV project, funding one of the two vessels requested. The joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report on the bill did not discuss conferees’ rationale for the cut. The Senate Armed Services Committee, in its report on the original, Senate-passed version of the bill had questioned the Navy’s plan to develop and procure these ships on an accelerated schedule, given their technological and operational novelty. Military Aircraft Procurement The FY2020 budget request sought to fund the procurement of 385 aircraft across the military services; this is 71 aircraft more than the total included in the projected FY2020 budget request published in early 2018. Generally speaking, the enacted version of the bill, like the versions passed earlier by the House and Senate -- authorizes the Administration’s requests, subject to relatively minor additions and reductions reflecting routine congressional oversight. One major departure from the request is an increase in the number of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters authorized.

Other Issues Border Wall Construction To construct a barrier along the U.S.-Mexican border, which Congress has not explicitly authorized as military construction, the Trump Administration used various budget transfer and reprogramming authorities to make available a total of $6.1 billion comprising DOD program savings and unobligated funds from prior fiscal years. In addition, its FY2020 budget request sought $7.2 billion in barrier-related military construction funding, of which $3.6 billion would replenish prior year funds that were transferred to barrier construction and $3.6 billion that would fund new barrier construction in FY2020. The enacted version of the FY2020 NDAA reduces from $8.0 billion (in FY2019) to $5.5 billion the total amount of DOD funding that could be transferred. It authorizes none of the $7.2 billion request in connection with the border barrier project. FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act: H.R. 2500, S. 1790 Congressional Research Service 22 The Senate bill would have reduced transfer authority by a smaller amount, the House bill by a larger amount. In addition, Sections 1046 and 2801 of the House bill would have prohibited the use of defense funds appropriated between FY2015 and FY2020 for barrier construction. (Table 11.) Table 11.

PFAS Contaminants PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are a large, diverse group of fluorinated compounds that have been used for several decades in numerous commercial, industrial, and U.S. military applications including use as an ingredient in aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) for extinguishing petroleum-based liquid fuel fires. Releases of certain PFAS have been detected in drinking water sources, other environmental media, and dairy milk at various locations, some of which have been associated with the use of AFFF at U.S. military installations. The House and Senate versions of the FY2020 NDAA each contained multiple provisions related to PFAS that would require DOD, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies to address potential risks of these chemicals under existing laws or new authorities. The conference agreement includes PFAS provisions related to drinking water and agricultural water sources, reporting of releases on the Toxics Release Inventory, data calls and significant new use notices under the Toxic Substances Control Act, environmental remediation at active and decommissioned U.S. military installations and National Guard facilities, DOD use and disposal of AFFF, and other purposes. The conference agreement does not include provisions regarding PFAS standards under the Clean Water Act or Safe Drinking Water Act, or liability for PFAS releases under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA often referred to as “Superfund”). FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act: H.R. 2500, S. 1790 Congressional Research Service 23 PFAS Contaminants For additional background, see CRS Report R45986, Federal Role in Responding to Potential Risks of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS), coordinated by David M.

Humphreys and Mary Tiemann; and CRS Report R45998, Contaminants of Emerging Concern under the Clean Water Act, by Laura Gatz. Paid Parental Leave for Federal Employees Sections 1121-1126 of the initial House-passed bill would have provided 12 weeks of paid leave to federal government employees covered by Title V, Chapter 63 of the U.S. Code for reasons covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended (P.L. 103-3). That legislation provides entitlement for such leave in the event of the employee’s own serious health condition and certain family-related situations including the birth, adoption, or fostering of a child; the serious illness of certain family members; and military family needs. The bill would have permitted the Office of Personnel Management to increase the amount of such paid leave to a total of 16 weeks. The same paid leave entitlement would have been provided to Legislative Branch employees covered by the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA) of 1995. Conforming amendments would have been included to extend benefits to Government Accountability Office (GAO) employees and certain TSA employees. The initial Senate-passed bill included no provision related to this subject. Sections 7601-7606 of the enacted version of the bill entitle federal employees (as described above) to 12 weeks of paid parental leave in connection with the birth, adoption, or fostering of a child. Federal civil service employees must meet the FMLA 12-months-of-service requirements before becoming eligible for the paid parental leave benefit; by contrast the FMLA eligibility requirements for Legislative Branch employees covered by the CAA and for GAO employees do not apply to the paid parental leave benefit. In addition, use of the paid parental leave benefit by federal civil service employees is conditioned upon an agreement from the employee that he or she will return to work for the employing agency for 12 workweeks following the conclusion of that leave. Should an employee fail to do so and if certain conditions enumerated in the bill do not apply, the employing agency may recoup its contributions to the employee’s health care premiums made during the period of leave. No such requirement is provided for Legislative Branch employees covered by the CAA nor for GAO employees.

The Defense Production Act of 1950: History, Authorities, and Considerations for Congress The Defense Production Act of 1950: History, Authorities, and Considerations for Congress Updated March 2, 2020 Congressional Research Service https://crsreports.congress.gov R43767 The Defense Production Act of 1950 Congressional Research Service Summary The Defense Production Act (DPA) of 1950 (P.L. 81-774, 50 U.S.C. §§4501 et seq.), as amended, confers upon the President a broad set of authorities to influence domestic industry in the interest of national defense. The authorities can be used across the federal government to shape the domestic industrial base so that, when called upon, it is capable of providing essential materials and goods needed for the national defense. Though initially passed in response to the Korean War, the DPA is historically based on the War Powers Acts of World War II. Gradually, Congress has expanded the term national defense, as defined in the DPA. Based on this definition, the scope of DPA authorities now extends beyond shaping U.S. military preparedness and capabilities, as the authorities may also be used to enhance and support domestic preparedness, response, and recovery from natural hazards, terrorist attacks, and other national emergencies. Some current DPA authorities include, but are not limited to  Title I: Priorities and Allocations, which allows the President to require persons (including businesses and corporations) to prioritize and accept contracts for materials and services as necessary to promote the national defense.  Title III: Expansion of Productive Capacity and Supply, which allows the President to incentivize the domestic industrial base to expand the production and supply of critical materials and goods. Authorized incentives include loans, loan guarantees, direct purchases and purchase commitments, and the authority to procure and install equipment in private industrial facilities.  Title VII: General Provisions, which includes key definitions for the DPA and several distinct authorities, including the authority to establish voluntary agreements with private industry; the authority to block proposed or pending foreign corporate mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers that threaten national security; and the authority to employ persons of outstanding experience and ability and to establish a volunteer pool of industry executives who could be called to government service in the interest of the national defense. These are not the exclusive authorities of the DPA, but rather some of the most pertinent because of their historical or current use. The authorities of the DPA are generally afforded to the President in the statute. The President, in turn, has delegated these authorities to department and agency heads in Executive Order 13603, National Defense Resource Preparedness, issued in 2012. While the authorities are most frequently used by, and commonly associated with, the Department of Defense (DOD), they can be and have been used by numerous other executive departments and agencies. Since 1950, the DPA has been reauthorized over 50 times, though significant authorities were terminated from the original law in 1953. Congress last reauthorized the DPA in Section 1791 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (P.L. 115-232). This extended the termination of the act by six years, from September 30, 2019, to September 30, 2025, when nearly all DPA authorities will terminate. A few authorities of the DPA, such as the Exon-Florio Amendment (which established government review of the acquisition of U.S. companies by foreigners) and anti-trust protections for certain voluntary industry agreements, have been made permanent by Congress. The DPA lies within the legislative jurisdiction of the House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. The Defense Production Act of 1950 Congressional Research Service Congress may consider enhancing its oversight of executive branch activities related to the DPA in a number of ways. To enhance oversight, Congress could expand executive branch reporting requirements, track and enforce rulemaking requirements, review the activities of the Defense Production Act Committee, and broaden the committee oversight jurisdiction of the DPA in Congress. Congress may also consider amending the DPA, either by creating new authorities or repealing existing ones. In addition, Congress may consider amending the definitions of the DPA to expand or restrict the DPA’s scope, amending the statute to supersede the President’s delegation of DPA authorities made in E.O. 13603, or consider adjusting future appropriations to the DPA Fund in order to manage the scope of Title III projects initiated by the President.

In the DPA, Congress has found that “the security of the United States is dependent on the ability of the domestic industrial base to supply materials and services for the national defense and to prepare for and respond to military conflicts, natural or man-caused disasters, or acts of terrorism within the United States.”2 Through the DPA, the President can, among other activities, prioritize government contracts for goods and services over competing customers, and offer incentives within the domestic market to enhance the production and supply of critical materials and technologies when necessary for national defense. Since 1950, the DPA has been reauthorized over 50 times by Congress, most recently in 2018 (Sec. 791 of P.L. 115-232). The majority of DPA authorities will expire on September 30, 2025, unless reauthorized. This report examines some of the extensive history of the DPA, focusing primarily on its creation and most recent legislative reauthorization. This report also discusses the foremost active authorities of the DPA. Nevertheless, this report is not intended to evaluate all authorities of the DPA comprehensively. For example, though significant authorities for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) are included in the DPA, CFIUS is generally considered separate and distinct from the DPA and this report defers to other CRS reports for in-depth discussion on that issue.3 This report also identifies relevant delegations of the President’s DPA authorities made in Executive Order (E.O.) 13603, National Defense Resources Preparedness.4 Finally, this report provides a brief overview of issues Congress may consider in its oversight of executive branch use of DPA authorities, as well as the implementation of changes made in the most recent reauthorization. The report also discusses congressional considerations for expanding, restricting, or otherwise modifying the authorities provided by the DPA through new legislation. As appendices to this report, several supplementary tables provide: additional resources related to various DPA subjects; a tabled analysis of key provisions of the DPA and related portions of E.O. 13603 and in regulations; the delegation of Title I priorities and allocations authority to Cabinet Secretaries in E.O. 13603; and a chronology of laws reauthorizing DPA authorities since first enactment. There is also an appendix discussing how DPA authorities changed as a result of the last major reauthorization of the law that included reforms (P.L. 113-172, To reauthorize the Defense Production Act, to improve the Defense Production Act Committee, and for other purposes).5 1 50 U.S.C. §§4501 et seq.

The Defense Production Act of 1950 Congressional Research Service 2 History of the DPA Origin The DPA was inspired by the First and Second War Powers Acts of 1941 and 1942, which gave the executive branch broad authority to regulate industry during World War II.6 Much of this authority lapsed at the end of that war, but the beginning of the Cold War with the Soviet Union in the late 1940s and the North Korean invasion of South Korea in June of 1950 caused the Truman Administration to reconsider the need for stronger executive authority in the interest of national defense.7 The original DPA, enacted on September 8, 1950, granted broad authority to the President to control national economic policy.8 Containing seven separate titles, the DPA allowed the President, among other powers, to demand that manufacturers give priority to defense production, to requisition materials and property, to expand government and private defense production capacity, ration consumer goods, fix wage and price ceilings, force settlement of some labor disputes, control consumer credit and regulate real estate construction credit and loans, provide certain antitrust protections to industry, and establish a voluntary reserve of private sector executives who would be available for emergency federal employment. Four of the seven titles (Titles II, IV, V, and VI), those which related to requisitioning, rationing, wage and price fixing, labor disputes, and credit controls and regulation, terminated in 1953 when Congress allowed them to lapse.9 6 First War Powers Act, 1941 (H.R. 6233, P.L. 77-354, 55 Stat. 838), and Second War Powers Act, 1942 (S. 2208, P.L. 77-507, 56 Stat. 176). The first of these statutes conferred considerable emergency power on the President to reorganize the executive branch, to enter into contracts and make payments on them, and to regulate “trade with the enemy.” The second act expanded the powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission to improve the efficiency of transportation of war materials; expanded an existing authority for military departments to acquire private property by condemnation, purchase, donation, or other transfer; permitted the Secretaries of War and the Navy to place orders and contracts and the President to give such contracts priority over all deliveries for private accounts or for export; and gave the President the authority to require acceptance of and performance under these contracts and to allocate materials and facilities for their fulfillment. The act also empowered the President to obtain information, records, and reports sufficient to enforce the provisions of the act and clarified existing law on the amount of compensation required if property was requisitioned for defense purposes. The act also included provisions relating to free postage for members of the military services, naturalization of persons serving in the armed forces, acceptance of conditional gifts to further the war program, metal content of coinage, inspection and audit of war contractors, and the gathering and assessment of war information by the Department of Commerce. 7 In a message sent to Congress at the outbreak of war in Korea in mid-1950, President Truman stated that the United States and the United Nations were responding to a military invasion of the Republic of Korea by forces from north of the 38th parallel, that the nation urgently needed additional military manpower, supplies, and equipment, and that the nation’s military and economic preparedness were inseparable. He urged Congress to pass legislation that would guarantee the prompt supply of adequate quantities of needed military and civilian goods, including measures to help compensate for manufacturing demand growth caused by military expansion.

P.L. 83-95 permitted the termination of Titles II and VI as of June 30, 1953, and Titles IV and V to terminate as of April 30, 1953. The Defense Production Act of 1950 Congressional Research Service 3 Committee Jurisdiction Though commonly associated with industrial production for the DOD, the DPA currently lies within the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Prior to 1975, House rules did not permit simultaneous referral of bills to two or more committees. Precedents in both chambers did not allow divided or joint referrals, regardless of bill content. Instead, bills were assigned to committees based on the preponderance of their subject matter. Because much of the President’s proposal dealt with economic policy, what became the Defense Production Act was assigned in 1950 to the House and Senate Committees on Banking and Currency (their successors are the House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs). Although the parts of the act dealing with the requisitioning of materials, wages and prices, labor, and credit are no longer in force, these committees have retained jurisdiction. In addition to the standing committees of jurisdiction, the original statute created a Joint Committee on Defense Production. This committee was composed of selected members from the standing Committees on Banking and Currency of the Senate and House. This committee was intended to review the programs established by the DPA and advise the standing committees whenever they drafted legislation on the subject. Although the provision in the DPA establishing the Joint Committee on Defense Production was officially repealed in 1992,10 in effect, the Joint Committee has not existed since 1977, when salaries and expenses for the committee were last funded.11 History of DPA Reauthorizations The DPA has been amended and reauthorized numerous times since its original enactment. Most notably, with the passage and enactment of P.L. 85-95, Congress reauthorized Titles I, III, and VII while allowing Titles II, IV, V, and VI of the DPA to expire in 1953.12 The Defense Production Act, like the War Power Acts that preceded it, included a sunset provision that has required periodic reauthorization and offered the opportunity for amendment. Congress passed the DPA in 1950 and has thus far reauthorized it 53 times, including many short-term “stop-gap” extensions. From time to time, the DPA has expired without Congress passing a law reauthorizing and extending its termination date. In such circumstances, Congress has often ultimately passed a law retroactively setting the effective date for the law to the previous expiration date. Most notably, for example, the DPA expired on October 20, 1990, and was not reauthorized until August 17, 1991. However, upon passage of P.L. 102-99, the effective date of the law was set to October 20, 1990. The DPA was most recently reauthorized by the 115th Congress, in Section 1791 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (P.L. 115-232). This extended the termination of the act by six years, from September 30, 2019, to September 30, 2025, when nearly all DPA authorities will terminate. See Table A-4 in the Appendix for a full chronology of reauthorizations. 10 Section 153 of the Defense Production Act Amendments of 1992 (P.L. 102-558, 106 Stat. 4219). 11 Although in 1977 Congress extended the 1950 Act through September 30, 1979 (P.L. 95-37), no appropriation for salaries and expenses of the Joint Committee was made for FY1978. The last appropriation for salaries and expenses for the Joint Committee was made in P.L. 94-440. 12 Act of June 30, 1953, Defense Production Act Amendments of 1953 (S. 1080, P.L. 83-95). The Defense Production Act of 1950 Congressional Research Service 4 Major Authorities of the DPA This section provides summaries of the major authorities granted to the President in the three remaining active titles of the DPA.13 Each summary describes how the DPA authorities are delegated to Cabinet officials or other offices of the U.S. government in the issued Executive Order (E.O.) 13603, National Defense Resource Preparedness.14 It is not intended to comprehensively evaluate all authorities in the DPA. The information provided below is reviewed in Table A-2 for select provisions of the DPA. Table A-1 also provides a list of additional materials, information, and resources on various topics of the DPA that may be of use to Congress. General Scope of the DPA The DPA provides the President an “array of authorities to shape national defense preparedness programs and to take appropriate steps to maintain and enhance the domestic industrial base.”15 [Italics added.] DPA authorities are tied to the definition of national defense, as the use of any major DPA authority must be interpreted to promote, support, or otherwise be deemed needed or essential for the national defense.16 National defense is currently defined in the statute as programs for military and energy production or construction, military or critical infrastructure assistance to any foreign nation, homeland security, stockpiling, space, and any directly related activity. Such term includes emergency preparedness activities conducted pursuant to title VI of The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act [42 U.S.C. §§5195 et seq.] and critical infrastructure protection and restoration.17 Further reference can be made to Title VI of the Stafford Act for a definition of “emergency preparedness” activities. It states that emergency preparedness: means all those activities and measures designed or undertaken to prepare for or minimize the effects of a hazard upon the civilian population, to deal with the immediate emergency conditions which would be created by the hazard, and to effectuate emergency repairs to, or the emergency restoration of, vital utilities and facilities destroyed or damaged by the hazard.18 Therefore, the use of DPA authorities extends beyond shaping U.S. military preparedness and capabilities, as the authorities may also be used to enhance and support domestic preparedness, 13 Titles I, III, and VII. The former Titles of the DPA (II, IV, V, and VI) terminated in 1953, but were officially repealed in the Reauthorization of 2009. 14 Executive Order 13603, “National Defense Resource Preparedness,” 77 Federal Register 16651, March 22, 2012. E.O. 13603 replaced the previous E.O. 12919 on National Defense Industrial Resource Preparedness, which had been issued by President William J. Clinton on June 3, 1994. See Executive Order 12919, “National Defense Industrial Resources Preparedness,” 59 Federal Register 29525, June 7, 1994. 15 50 U.S.C. §4502(a)(4); Section 2(a)(4) of the DPA (emphasis added). 16 There are various references to national defense throughout the DPA. Some examples: Title I, Section 101 priorities and allocations authority requires the President to deem action as “necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense” (50 U.S.C. §4511(a)); Title III authorities can be used when “essential for the national defense” (50 U.S.C. §§4531(a), 4532(a), 4533(a)); and Title VII voluntary agreement authority requires that the use helps “provide for the national defense” (50 U.S.C. §4558(c)(1)). 17 50 U.S.C. §4552(14); Section 702(14) of the DPA. 18 42 U.S.C. §5195(a)(3) The Defense Production Act of 1950 Congressional Research Service 5 response, and recovery from hazards, terrorist attacks, and other national emergencies, among other purposes. In its original 1950 form, the DPA defined national defense as “the operations and activities of the armed forces, the Atomic Energy Commission, or any other department or agency directly or indirectly and substantially concerned with the national defense... ”19 Over the many reauthorizations and amendments to the DPA, Congress has gradually expanded the scope of the definition of national defense, as recently as 2009.20 At that time, Congress included critical infrastructure assistance to any foreign nation and added homeland security to the definition.21 The DPA statute also includes both a full Congressional “Findings” and “Statement of Policy,” as set forth in the “Declaration of Policy” section of the DPA.22 This section of the law gives additional guidance—though not explicit legal requirements—to the executive branch on why and how the DPA authorities should be used in order to provide for the national security. For example, in the “Findings” section, with regards to national defense and energy security, Congress stated that to further assure the adequate maintenance of the domestic industrial base, to the maximum extent possible, domestic energy supplies should be augmented through reliance on renewable energy sources (including solar, geothermal, wind, and biomass sources), more efficient energy storage and distribution technologies, and energy conservation measures.23 As another example, as guidance to the executive branch on how the defense industrial base should be encouraged to develop, in the “Statement of Policy,” Congress stated that it is the policy of the United States that... in order to ensure productive capacity in the event of an attack on the United States, the United States Government should encourage the geographic dispersal of industrial facilities in the United States to discourage the concentration of such productive facilities within limited geographic areas that are vulnerable to attack by an enemy of the United States.24 Authorities under Title I of the DPA Priorities and Allocations Authority Section 101(a) of Title I of the DPA states The President is authorized (1) to require that performance under contracts or orders (other than contracts of employment) which he deems necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense shall take priority over performance under any other contract or order, and, for the purpose of assuring such priority, to require acceptance and performance of such contracts or orders in preference to other contracts or orders by any person he finds 19 See Section 702(d) of P.L. 81-774. 20 For further discussion of the evolution of the definition of national defense, see The National Infrastructure Advisory Council, Framework for Dealing with Disasters and Related Interdependencies: Final Report and Recommendations, Appendix G: The Defense Production Act, Washington, DC, July 14, 2009, pp. 41-42, at http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/niac/niac_framework_dealing_with_disasters.pdf. 21 123 Stat. 2017, Section 8 of P.L. 111-67. Both “critical infrastructure” and “homeland security” are defined in Section 702 of the DPA, 50 U.S.C. §4552. 22 50 U.S.C. §4502; Section 2 of the DPA. This section comprises congressional findings, Section 2(a), and a statement of policy of the United States, Section 2(b). 23 50 U.S.C. §4502(a)(6); Section 2(a)(6) of the DPA. 24 50 U.S.C. §4502(b)(6); Section 2(b)(6) of the DPA. The Defense Production Act of 1950 Congressional Research Service 6 to be capable of their performance, and (2) to allocate materials, services, and facilities in such manner, upon such conditions, and to such extent as he shall deem necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense.25 The priority performance authority allows the federal government to ensure the timely availability of critical materials, equipment, and services produced in the private market in the interest of national defense, and to receive those materials, equipment, and services through contracts before any other competing interest.26 Under the language of the DPA, a person (including corporations, as defined in statute)27 is required to accept prioritized contracts/orders,28 though regulations implementing Title I authorities provide practical exemptions to this mandate. The limited allowances for when a person is required to or may optionally reject a prioritized order can be superseded by the direction of the implementing federal department.29 In executing a contract under the DPA, a contractor is not liable for actions taken to comply with governing rules, regulations, and orders (e.g., prioritization requirements), including any rules, regulations, or orders later declared legally invalid.30 The government can also prioritize the performance of contracts between two private parties, such as a contract between a prime contractor and a subcontractor, if needed to fulfill a priority contract and promote the national defense.31 Title I also allows the President to allocate or control the general distribution of materials, services, and facilities. Allocation authority relates historically to the controlled materials programs of World War II, when the distribution of critical materials and resources had to be managed to maximize the production of goods needed in the war effort.32 No allocation action has been taken by the President since the end of the Cold War.33 There are several notable restrictions to the priorities and allocation authority. For example, it cannot be used for contracts of employment.34Additionally, unless authorized by a joint resolution of Congress, the authority cannot be used for wage or price controls. Private persons are also not 25 50 U.S.C. §4511(a); Section 101(a) of the DPA. 26 As noted in regulations for Title I authorities, especially 15 C.F.R. §700.1(b), this priority authority is broader than similar priority authorities provided in other statutes including Section 18 of the Selective Service Act of 1948 (50 U.S.C. §3816). 27 50 U.S.C. §4552(15), Section 702(15) of the DPA, defines person as “individual, corporation, partnership, association, or any other organized group of persons, or legal successor or representative thereof, or any State or local government or agency thereof.” 28 Contracts and “rated orders” have the same meaning in the regulations for Title I authorities. See, for example, the definition for “rated order” provided by 15 C.F.R. §700.8. 29 See, for example, the regulations establishing standards and procedures for the use of the Secretaries’ of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Health and Human Services, and Transportation delegated authorities under Title I of the DPA (7 C.F.R. §786.13, 15 C.F.R. §700.13, 10 C.F.R. §217.33, 45 C.F.R. §101.33, and 49 C.F.R. §33.33, respectively). These regulations explain the circumstances under which a person may reject a prioritized contract, though these conditions are limited by the clause “Unless otherwise directed by the [implementing department].” 30 50 U.S.C. §4557; Section 707 of the DPA. Immunity under this provision is limited, and does not confer blanket tort immunity to a contractor for liability to injured third parties. Also, carrying out a contract according to its terms does not necessarily entitle a contractor to be indemnified by the government when the resulting product injures third parties, absent an indemnification clause in the contract. Hercules v. United States, 516 U.S. 417 (1996). 31 See, for example, 15 C.F.R. §700.3(d). 32 See further explanation of allocation authority in 15 C.F.R. §700.30. 33 Department of Homeland Security, The Defense Production Act Committee Report to Congress, Calendar Year 2017 Report to Congress, June 18, 2019, p. 11. 34 This restriction is written as a parenthetical in Section 101(a)(1), but is a considerable constraint on Title I priorities authority. The Defense Production Act of 1950 Congressional Research Service 7 required to assist in the production or development of chemical or biological weapons unless directly authorized by the President or a Cabinet secretary.35 Title I also contains several provisions related to domestic energy. Section 101(c) specifically authorizes the President to allocate and prioritize contracts relating to materials, equipment, and services to maximize domestic energy supplies in certain circumstances.36 However, Section 101(c) also restricts this use unless the President makes certain findings.37 Further, Section 105 of the DPA restricts the authorities from being used to ration the end-use of gasoline without the approval of Congress.38 Section 106 of Title I, as amended, also designates energy as a strategic and critical material.39 This designation enables other authorities in the DPA, especially Title III authorities discussed below, to be used for policy purposes related to energy. Delegations of Title I Authorities In statute, Title I priorities and allocation authority can only be used to “promote national defense.” In E.O. 13603, the President further constrains that authority so that it “may be used only to support programs that have been determined in writing as necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense” by either the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or the Secretary of Energy, depending on the issue involved. The Secretary of Defense makes determinations related to military production and construction, military assistance to foreign nations, military use of civil transportation, stockpiles managed by DOD, space, and directly related activities; the Secretary of Energy makes determinations related to energy production and construction, distribution and use, and directly related activities; and the Secretary of Homeland Security makes determinations related to all other national defense programs, including civil defense and continuity of government.40 Once a program is determined to promote the national defense, other Secretaries who have been delegated the priorities and allocation authority can use their authority for those pre-designated program purposes. E.O. 13603 provides for the delegation of the President’s priorities and 35 50 U.S.C. §4514; Section 104 of the DPA. It should be noted that development and production of chemical weapons and biological weapons are prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), respectively. The United States is a state party to both of these international treaties and is legally bound by their obligations and prohibitions. 36 50 U.S.C. §4511(c); Section 101(c) of the DPA. 37 50 U.S.C. §4511(c)(2); Section 101(c)(2) of the DPA stipulates that the Title I authority related to domestic energy “may not be used to require priority performance of contracts or orders, or to control the distribution of any supplies of materials, services, and facilities in the marketplace, unless the President finds that— (A) such materials, services, and facilities are scarce, critical, and essential— (i) to maintain or expand exploration, production, refining, transportation; (ii) to conserve energy supplies; or (iii) to construct or maintain energy facilities; and (B) maintenance or expansion of exploration, production, refining, transportation, or conservation of energy supplies or the construction and maintenance of energy facilities cannot reasonably be accomplished without exercising the authority specified in paragraph (1) of this subsection.” 38 50 U.S.C. §4515; Section 105 of the DPA. 39 50 U.S.C. §4516; Section 106 of the DPA. 40 See Section 202 of E.O. 13603. An example of a written determination, issued by the Department of Homeland Security through FEMA, can be found at http://www.fema.gov/pdf/about/programs/dpa/signed-program-determinations-100506.pdf. The Defense Production Act of 1950 Congressional Research Service 8 allocation authority to six different Cabinet Secretaries based upon their areas of expertise in different resource and material sectors. These resource areas are further defined in Section 801 of E.O. 13603. In practice, the priorities authority held by one Cabinet Secretary is frequently allowed to be used by other federal agencies, thereby allowing one agency to use another agency’s authorities (e.g., DHS was allowed to use the Department of Agriculture’s priorities authority related to food resources).41 Table A-3 in the Appendix summarizes this delegation of priorities and allocation authority. Each of the six federal agencies to which the President delegated priorities and allocations authority are required by law to issue and annually review regulations that “establish standards and procedures by which the priorities and allocations authority under this section is used to promote the national defense, under both emergency and nonemergency conditions.”42 Five of the six delegated the authority—the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Health and Human Services, and Transportation—have issued those regulations. DOD has not issued its regulation as it relates to using the priorities and allocation authority for water resources, as of November 20, 2018. However, DOD has indicated that its regulation is in preliminary draft.43 Historically, the Department of Commerce’s rule establishing the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) has been the most frequently used by the executive branch. As encouraged by statute, the DPAS regulation was used as a model to create a “consistent and unified Federal priorities and allocations system.”44 This system is referred to as the “Federal Priorities and Allocations System” (FPAS).45 Each of the regulations that make up the FPAS establish two levels of priority for issued orders notated as “DO” and “DX.” In the DPAS regulations, a “DO” rating is lower than a “DX” rating. A “DO” rating order for a product means that it must be prioritized over all other nonrated orders. However, if a product that has a “DO” rated order is needed for a different “DX” rated order, the “DX” rated order takes precedence. As a matter of practice, few select programs may receive a “DX” rating.46 Examples of Use of Title I Authorities The authority to prioritize contracts is routinely employed by DOD. These prioritized contracts are typically issued under the Department of Commerce’s (DOC’s) delegated authority with respect to materials, services, and facilities, including construction materials, and under its Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) regulations guiding the use of this authority.47 DOD has reported that it includes a priority rating as a standard clause in virtually all eligible contracts and orders for items under DOC’s resource jurisdiction.48 Some past examples of DOD’s use of Title I priorities authority include supporting the Integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System, the B-2 Bomber, the VC-25A Presidential Aircraft (i.e., Air Force One), and 41 Department of Homeland Security, The Defense Production Act Committee: Report to Congress, Calendar Year 2017 Report, June 18, 2019, p. 11. 42 50 U.S.C. §4511(d)(1), Sec. 101(d)(1) of the DPA. 43 Email response from Department of Defense, Legislative Affairs, November 8, 2018. 44 50 U.S.C. §4511(d)(2), Sec. 101(d)(2) of the DPA. 45 For additional information on FPAS, see FEMA’s website about it at https://www.fema.gov/federal-priorities-and-allocations-system. 46 For a discussion of the different priority ratings, see 15 C.F.R. §700.11. 47 Ibid.

For example, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has prioritized contracts in support of the Terrorist Screening Center program and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers prioritized contracts in support of the Greater New Orleans Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System program.50 The Federal Emergency Management Agency used the authority extensively during the 2017 disaster season, including prioritizing contracts for manufactured housing units, food and bottled water, and the restoration of electrical transmission and distribution systems in Puerto Rico.51 Further, U.S. allies have used the authority to assist with defense-related procurement issues.52 The specific Title I prioritization and allocation authorities related to domestic energy (Section 101(c) of the DPA) was used by the Department of Energy to ensure that emergency supplies of natural gas continued to flow to California utilities, helping to avoid threatened electrical blackouts in early 2001.53 Unlike the prioritization authority, the allocation authority has not been used since the Cold War. The authority does support the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program, which was created initially in 1951, and is now managed by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Under the CRAF program, civilian aircraft are “allocated” for the potential use, if required, by the DOD so that it may augment its airlift capability with civilian aircraft during a national defense related crisis. In return for their participation in the CRAF program, civilian carriers are given preference in carrying commercial peacetime cargo and passenger traffic for the DOD.54 Authorities Under Title III of the DPA Title III authorities are intended to help ensure that the nation has an adequate supply of, or the ability to produce, essential materials and goods necessary for the national defense. Using Title III authorities, the President may provide appropriate financial incentives to develop, maintain, modernize, restore, and expand the production capacity of domestic sources for critical components, critical technology items, materials, and industrial resources essential for the execution of the national security strategy of the United States.55 The President is also directed to use Title III authorities to ensure that critical components, critical technology items, essential 49 For a list of Department of Defense programs that were approved for DX-rating as of March 2016, see https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/forms-documents/pdfs/1257-dx-rated-program-list/file. 50 U.S. Congress, House Committee on Financial Services, Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade, Reauthorizing the Defense Production Act, 113th Cong., 1st sess., May 8, 2013, H.Hrg. 113-18 (Washington: GPO, 2013), p. 13. 51 Department of Homeland Security, The Defense Production Act Committee: Report to Congress, Calendar Year 2017 Report, June 18, 2018, p. 10. 52 As reported by DOD, “For example, in FY2012, a U.S. ally asked for help in expediting the refurbishment of naval vessel environmental control systems.

A loan guarantee allows the federal government to guarantee a loan made by a nonfederal lender to a nonfederal borrower, either by pledging to pay back all or part of the loan in cases when the borrower is unable to do so. These authorities, for instance, could be used to provide a loan, or to guarantee a loan, to a defense contractor that is responsible for the provision of critical services essential to the national defense when credit is otherwise unavailable in the private market. There are a number of restrictions placed on the executive branch before these loan authorities may be used in the interest of national defense. First, the budget authority for guarantees and direct loans must be specifically included in appropriations passed by Congress and enacted by the President before such loan mechanisms can be issued.59 Except during periods of national emergency declared by Congress or the President,60 the DPA statute also requires the President to determine that loan guarantees or direct loans meet a number of conditions before issuance. One of the conditions in using the loan authority is that the loan or loan guarantee is the most cost-effective, expedient, and practical alternative method for meeting the need.61 There are also a number of determination requirements for loan guarantees and direct loans that may help ensure that the loan is repaid by the recipient.62 For example, the President is required to determine that there is “reasonable assurance” that a recipient of a loan or loan guarantee will be able to repay the loan.63 Purchase, Purchase Commitments, and Installation of Equipment Section 303 of Title III grants the President an array of authorities to create, maintain, protect, expand, or restore domestic industrial base capabilities essential to the national defense.64 These authorities include, but are not limited to 56 50 U.S.C. §4517; Section 107(b)(1) of the DPA. 57 50 U.S.C. §4531(a)(1).

The scope of Section 303 authorities allows for these incentives to be structured in a number of ways, including direct purchases or subsidies of such goods. Therefore, whereas Title I authorities help ensure that the government has priority access to goods that are already being produced by domestic industries, Section 303 authorities help create a sufficient supply of these essential goods in the interest of national defense. Prior to using Section 303 authorities, the law requires the President, on a nondelegable basis, to determine that there is a “domestic industrial base shortfall” for a particular industrial resource, material, or critical technology item that threatens the national defense.68 This determination includes finding that the industry of the United States cannot reasonably be expected to provide the capability for the good in a timely manner, and that purchases, purchase commitments, or other actions are the most cost effective, expedient, and practical alternative method for meeting the need.69 For projects that cumulatively cost more than $50 million to address an industrial base shortfall, the projects must first be authorized by an act of Congress. Additionally, the President is required to notify the committees of jurisdiction, and give the committees 30 days to comment, when the actions to remedy the shortfall are expected to exceed $50 million.70 Generally, very few Title III projects exceed the $50 million threshold. The President is authorized to waive the determination and notification provisions in periods of national emergency or in situations that the President, on a nondelegable basis, determines the industrial base shortfall would severely impair national defense.71 65 50 U.S.C. §4533(a), Section 303(a)(1)(A) of the DPA.

However, changes to the DPA in P.L. 113-72 made subsequent to the issuance of the E.O. 13603 have overridden these delegations because the President is no longer allowed to delegate this determination and notification responsibility. 69 50 U.S.C. §4533(a)(5)(B) and (C), Section 303(a)(5)(B) and (C) of the DPA. 70 50 U.S.C. §4533(a)(6), Section 303(a)(6) of the DPA. 71 50 U.S.C. §4533(a)(7), Section 303(a)(7) of the DPA. The Defense Production Act of 1950 Congressional Research Service 12 DOD’s Broad Agency Announcement Under the DPA In February 2018, DOD’s DPA Title III office (located in the office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Policy) issued a Broad Agency Announcement requesting interested parties to submit white papers or proposals for “projects that create, maintain, protect, expand, or restore domestic industrial base capabilities essential for the national defense.” The announcement identified three broad focus areas for potential projects:  Sustainment of Critical Production,  Commercialization of R&D Investments, and  Scaling of Emerging Technologies. A Broad Agency Announcement is a method by which an agency solicits interest in solving a development problem. No budget is allocated and no particular procurement approach is determined in advance. Such announcements, however, often lead to a contract, grant, or some other financial agreement. (For more information on this particular BPA, see https://www.businessdefense.gov/DPA-Title-III/Opportunities/.) Delegation of Section 301, 302, and 303 Authorities in E.O. 13603 In E.O. 13603, the “head of each agency engaged in procurement for national defense” is delegated the majority of the authorities of Sections 301, 302, and 303 of Title III of the DPA.72 These agencies are specifically identified in E.O. 13603.73 This delegation includes the ability to make all determinations not explicitly cited in the statute as being nondelegable.74 However, this delegation does not include the authority to encourage the exploration, development, and mining of strategic and critical materials and other materials. This authority is provided to the President in the statute, and is delegated only to the Secretaries of Defense and the Interior.75 Defense Production Act Fund Title III of the DPA establishes a Treasury account, the Defense Production Act Fund, which is available to carry out all of the provisions and purposes of Title III. The DPA Fund is also used to collect all proceeds from DPA activities under Title III, such as the resale of DPA-procured commodities or products.76 The monies in the DPA Fund are available until expended. However, the unobligated balance in the DPA Fund at the end of any fiscal year cannot exceed $750 million, excluding monies appropriated for that fiscal year.77 Table 1 provides the appropriations to the DPA Fund between FY2010 and FY2020. It is possible for appropriations to the DPA Fund to be made in any of the bills providing funding to the 72 See Sections 301, 302, 303, 304, and 305 of E.O. 13603. 73 Section 801(h) of E.O. 13603 states “the heads of the Departments of State, Justice, the Interior, and Homeland Security, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the General Services Administration, and all other agencies with authority delegated under section 201 of this order.” Under Section 201 of the executive order, the additional agencies are the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, and Transportation. 74 Section 305 of E.O. 13603. 75 In statute, see 50 U.S.C. §4533(a)(1)(B); Section 303(a)(1)(B) of the DPA. The authority is delegated in Section 306 of E.O. 13603. The Secretary of Interior is delegated this authority in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, as the National Defense Stockpile Manager. 76 50 U.S.C. §4534; Section 304 of the DPA. 77 50 U.S.C. §4534(e); Section 304(e) of the DPA.

The Defense Production Act of 1950 Congressional Research Service 13 numerous agencies delegated Title III authorities.78 All recent discretionary appropriations directly to the DPA Fund have come from DOD appropriations acts. As noted in Table 1, however, in FY2014-2016, the Department of Energy was authorized, and subsequently made, transfers of $45 million to the DPA Fund each year from another appropriation.79 In addition, Title III projects that are paid for through the DPA Fund have been funded through transfers of budget authority from DOD and other federal agencies.80 Between 2000 and 2018, the average total project size for Title III projects was $25.13 million. Of that total, an average of $14.02 million was provided by the DPA Fund, while an average of $0.95 million came from other government funding, and an average of $10.21 million was provided by private sector partners as a cost-share.81 Table 1.

In FYs 2014, 2015, and 2016, Congress also authorized the Department of Energy to transfer up to $45 million to the DPA Fund from each FY appropriation from the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy account. For FY2014, see P.L. 113-76, 128 Stat. 165; for FY2015, see P.L. 113-235, 128 Stat. 2313; for FY2016, P.L. 114-113, 129 Stat. 2408. These transfers were made by DOE, for a total of $135 million. 78 See footnote 73 for an explanation and full list of the delegated agencies with Title III authorities. 79 A total of $135 million was transferred between FY2014 and FY2016. In its FY2014 budget request, DOE stated the $45 million would be used to support the construction of commercial-scale biofuels production facilities that can produce drop-in, hydrocarbon biofuels under a joint DOD-Navy, DOE, and USDA memorandum of agreement. A total of $135 million was transferred between FY2014 and FY2016. 80 For example, a Title III project on “Read Out Integrated Circuit Foundry Improvement and Sustainability” has been funded in part with budget authority transferred from the Air Force, Missile Defense Agency, and another government agency.

Email response from Department of Defense, Legislative Affairs, November 8, 2018. The Defense Production Act of 1950 Congressional Research Service 14 The President is required to designate a “Fund manager” to carry out general accounting functions for the fund.82 The Secretary of Defense has been designated to be the Fund Manager in E.O. 13603.83 As the Fund Manager, the Secretary of Defense (or official to whom the authority is further delegated in DOD) is responsible for the financial accounting of the fund, but does not necessarily have decision-making authority over the use of the fund. Examples of Use of Title III Authorities According to the Defense Production Act Committee, the federal government has not used the loan authorities provided in Section 301 or Section 302 of Title III in more than 30 years.84 Rather, current projects are initiated under Section 303 of Title III of the DPA. During FY2017, the DOD reported that it “managed 22 [Title III] projects and oversaw 7 projects in the monitoring phase. Three projects were completed, eight projects were in active acquisition, and seven projects were explored as potential future efforts.”85 Examples of Title III projects include an “Advanced Drop-In Biofuel Production Project” to accelerate the commercialization of drop-in biofuels for military and commercial use,86 and several projects to support radar and electronic warfare, including to establish a domestic, economically viable, open-foundry merchant supplier production capability for Ka-band gallium nitride (GaN) MMICs [monolithic microwave integrated circuits].87 Like many other Title III projects, these are meant to establish a domestic capacity to produce advanced technologies deemed essential for national defense by the President.88 Authorities Under Title VII of the DPA Title VII of the DPA contains various provisions that clarify how DPA authorities should and can be used, as well as additional presidential authorities. Some significant provisions of Title VII are summarized below. Special Preference for Small Businesses Two provisions in the DPA direct the President to accord special preference to small businesses when issuing contracts under DPA authorities. Section 701 reiterates89 and expands upon a requirement in Section 108 of Title I directing the President to “accord a strong preference for 82 50 U.S.C. §4534(f); Section 304(f) of the DPA. 83 Section 309 of E.O. 13603. 84 Department of Homeland Security, The Defense Production Act Committee: Report to Congress, Calendar Year 2010 Report, August 2011, p. 10. 85 Department of Defense, Annual Industrial Capabilities, Fiscal Year 2017 Report to Congress, March 2018, p. 33, at https://www.businessdefense.gov/Portals/51/Documents/Resources/2017%20AIC%20RTC%2005-17-2018%20-%20Public%20Release.pdf?ver=2018-05-17-224631-340. 86 Department of Defense, Annual Industrial Capabilities, Fiscal Year 2015 Report to Congress, September 2016, p.

The Defense Production Act of 1950 Congressional Research Service 15 small business concerns which are subcontractors or suppliers, and, to the maximum extent practicable, to such small business concerns located in areas of high unemployment or areas that have demonstrated a continuing pattern of economic decline, as identified by the Secretary of Labor.”90 Definitions of Key Terms in the DPA The DPA statute historically has included a section of definitions.91 Though national defense is perhaps the most important term, there are additional definitions provided both in current law and in E.O. 13603.92 Over time, the list of definitions provided in both the law and implementing executive orders has been added to and edited, most recently in 2009, when Congress added a definition for homeland security93 to place it within the context of national defense.94 Industrial Base Assessments To appropriately use numerous authorities of the DPA, especially Title III authorities, the President may require a detailed understanding of current domestic industrial capabilities and therefore need to obtain extensive information from private industries. Under Section 705 of the DPA, the President may “by regulation, subpoena, or otherwise obtain such information from ... any person as may be necessary or appropriate, in his discretion, to the enforcement or the administration of this Act [the DPA].”95 This authority is delegated to the Secretary of Commerce in E.O. 13603.96 Though this authority has many potential implications and uses, it is most commonly associated with what the DOC’s Bureau of Industry and Security calls “industrial base assessments.”97 These assessments are often conducted in coordination with other federal agencies and the private sector to “monitor trends, benchmark industry performance, and raise awareness of diminishing manufacturing capabilities.”98 The statute requires the President to issue regulations to insure that the authority is used only after “the scope and purpose of the investigation, inspection, or inquiry to be made have been defined by competent authority, and it 90 50 U.S.C. §4518; Section 108(a) of the DPA. 91 The original law provided five definitions, including a definition of “national defense.” See Section 702 of P.L. 81-774. 92 In total, there are 17 terms defined in law in 50 U.S.C. §4552, and 13 additional definitions in Section 801 of E.O. 13603. 93 50 U.S.C. §4552(11). Homeland security means efforts “(A) to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States; (B) to reduce the vulnerability of the United States to terrorism; (C) to minimize damage from a terrorist attack in the United States; and (D) to recover from a terrorist attack in the United States.” 94 123 Stat 2017-2018. Congress amended, in addition to the definition of national defense, the existing definitions of critical component, critical technology, domestic industrial base, industrial resources, and services. Congress struck the definitions for critical industry for national security, essential weapon system, and small business concern owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Congress added the definitions guaranteeing agency and homeland security. 95 50 U.S.C. §4555(a); Section 705(a) of the DPA. 96 Generally, see Section 104(d) of E.O. 13603. 97 For examples of some publically available industrial base assessments, see the agency’s website at http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/office-of-technology-evaluation-ote/industrial-base-assessments. 98 Ibid. The Defense Production Act of 1950 Congressional Research Service 16 is assured that no adequate and authoritative data are available from any Federal or other responsible agency.”99 This regulation has been issued by DOC.100 Voluntary Agreements Normally, voluntary agreements or plans of action between competing private industry interests could be subject to legal sanction under anti-trust statutes or contract law. Title VII of the DPA authorizes the President to “consult with representatives of industry, business, financing, agriculture, labor, and other interests in order to provide for the making by such persons, with the approval of the President, of voluntary agreements and plans of action to help provide for the national defense.”101 The President must determine that a “condition exists which may pose a direct threat to the national defense or its preparedness programs”102 prior to engaging in the consultation process. Following the consultation process, the President or presidential delegate may approve and implement the agreement or plan of action.103 Parties entering into such voluntary agreements are afforded a special legal defense if their actions within that agreement would otherwise violate antitrust or contract laws.104 Historically, the National Infrastructure Advisory Council noted that the voluntary agreement authority has been used to “enable companies to cooperate in weapons manufacture, solving production problems and standardizing designs, specifications and processes,” among other examples.105 It could also be used, for example, to develop a plan of action with private industry for the repair and reconstruction of major critical infrastructure systems following a domestic disaster. The authority to establish a voluntary agreement has been delegated to the head of any federal department or agency otherwise delegated authority under any other part of E.O. 13603.106 Thus, the authority could be potentially used by a large group of federal departments and agencies. Use of these voluntary agreements is tracked by the Secretary of Homeland Security,107 who is tasked under E.O. 13603 with issuing regulations that are required by law on the “standards and procedures by which voluntary agreements and plans of action may be developed and carried out.”108 The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which at the time was an independent agency and tasked with these responsibilities under the DPA, issued regulations in 1981 to fulfill this requirement.109 FEMA is now a part of DHS, and those regulations remain in effect. 99 50 U.S.C. §4555(a); Section 705(a) of the DPA. 100 See 15 C.F.R.

These exemptions do not grant them blanket immunity from these laws. 105 The National Infrastructure Advisory Council, Framework for Dealing with Disasters and Related Interdependencies: Final Report and Recommendations, Appendix G: The Defense Production Act, Washington, DC, July 14, 2009, p. 45, at http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/niac/niac_framework_dealing_with_disasters.pdf. 106 Section 401 of E.O. 13603. 107 Section 401 of E.O. 13603. 108 50 U.S.C. §4558(e); Section 708(e) of the DPA. 109 FEMA’s regulations can be found at 44 C.F.R.

The Defense Production Act of 1950 Congressional Research Service 17 The Maritime Administration (MARAD) of the U.S. Department of Transportation manages the only currently established voluntary agreements in the federal government, the Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement (commonly referred to as “VISA”) and the Voluntary Tanker Agreement. These programs are maintained in partnership with the U.S. Transportation Command of DOD, and have been established to ensure that the maritime industry can respond to the rapid mobilization, deployment, and transportation requirements of DOD. Voluntary participants from the maritime industry are solicited to join the agreements annually.110 Nucleus Executive Reserve Title VII of the DPA authorizes the President to establish a volunteer body of industry executives, the “Nucleus Executive Reserve,” or more frequently called the National Defense Executive Reserve (NDER).111 The NDER would be a pool of individuals with recognized expertise from various segments of the private sector and from government (except full-time federal employees). These individuals would be brought together for training in executive positions within the federal government in the event of an emergency that requires their employment. The historic concept of the NDER has been used as a means of improving the war mobilization and productivity of industries.112 The head of any governmental department or agency may establish a unit of the NDER and train its members.113 No NDER unit is currently active, though the statute and E.O. 13603 still provide for this possibility. Units may be activated only when the Secretary of Homeland Security declares in writing that “an emergency affecting the national defense exists and that the activation of the unit is necessary to carry out the emergency program functions of the agency.”114 Authorization of Appropriations, as amended by P.L. 113-72 Appropriations for the purpose of the DPA are authorized by Section 711 of Title VII.115 Prior to the P.L. 113-172, “such sums as necessary” were authorized to be appropriated. This has been replaced by a specific authorization for an appropriation of $133 million per fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, starting in FY2015, to carry out the provisions and purposes of the Defense Production Act.116 110 For more, see approval of the VISA program in the Federal Register at Maritime Administration, “Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement,” 79 Federal Register 64462, October 29, 2014.

Eisenhower created the NDER in 1956 by issuing E.O.10660 under the authorities granted in Title VII. It has served as a vehicle for training highly qualified private industry executives in war production mobilization should the nation be faced with the need to place the nation’s industrial base on a war footing. This program was inspired by the experiences of the War Industries Board of World War I and the War Production Board of World War II, when corporate executives were brought into government service, often with little or no compensation, to organize the nation’s industries for war production. For background on the origins and operation of the War Industries Board, see Paul A. C. Koistinen, “The ‘Industrial-Military Complex’ in Historical Perspective: World War I,” The Business History Review, vol. 41, no. 4 (Winter 1967), pp. 378-403; and Robert D.

The Defense Production Act of 1950 Congressional Research Service 18 Table 1 shows that the annual average appropriation to the DPA Fund between FY2010 and FY2019 was $109.1 million,117 with a high of $223.5 million in FY2013 and a low of $34.3 million in FY2011. Monies in the DPA Fund are available until expended, so annual appropriations may carry over from year to year if not expended. Recently, the only regular annual appropriation for the purposes of the DPA has been made in the DOD appropriations bill, though appropriations could be made in other bills directly to the DPA Fund (or transferred from other appropriations). Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States118 The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is an interagency committee that serves the President in overseeing the national security implications of foreign investment in the economy. It reviews foreign investment transactions to determine if (1) they threaten to impair U.S. national security; (2) the foreign investor is controlled by a foreign government; or (3) the transaction could affect homeland security or would result in control of any critical infrastructure that could impair the national security. The President has the authority to block proposed or pending foreign investment transactions that threaten to impair the national security. CFIUS initially was created and operated through a series of Executive Orders.119 In 1988, Congress passed the “Exon-Florio” amendment to the DPA, granting the President authority to review certain corporate mergers, acquisitions, and takeovers, and to investigate the potential impact on national security of such actions.120 This amendment codified the CFIUS review process due in large part to concerns over acquisitions of U.S. defense-related firms by Japanese investors. In 2007, amid growing concerns over the proposed foreign purchase of commercial operations of six U.S. ports, Congress passed the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-49) to create CFIUS in statute. On August 13, 2018, President Trump signed into law new rules governing national security reviews of foreign investment, known as the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA, Title XVII, P.L. 115-235).121 FIRRMA amends several aspects of the CFIUS review process under Section 721 of the DPA.122 Notably, it expands the scope of transactions that fall under CFIUS’ jurisdiction. It maintains core components of the current CFIUS process for evaluating proposed or pending investments in U.S. firms, but increases the allowable time for reviews and investigations. Upon receiving written notification of a proposed acquisition, merger, 117 This average figure increases by $9 million to $136.72 if one includes the $45 million authorized transfer from the overall appropriation of $1,912 million for the Department of Energy’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy account in FY2014. 118 This section was written by James K. Jackson, Specialist in International Trade and Finance and Cathleen Cimino-Isaacs, Analyst in International Trade and Finance. For more information on CFIUS, see CRS Report RL33388, The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), by James K. Jackson, and CRS In Focus IF10952, CFIUS Reform Under FIRRMA, by James K. Jackson and Cathleen D. Cimino-Isaacs. 119 The various CFIUS authorities are not delegated by the President in E.O. 13603 with the majority of other DPA authorities. Rather, CFIUS authorities are delegated by the President in E.O. 11858, Foreign Investment in the United States, as amended, which was originally issued in 1975 but has been amended since then (notably by E.O. 13456, Further Amendment of Executive Order 11858 Concerning Foreign Investment in the United States). See Executive Order 13456, “Foreign Investment in the United States,” 73 Federal Register 4677, January 25, 2008. 120 50 U.S.C. §4565; Section 721 of the DPA. 121 For more detail on FIRRMA, see CRS In Focus IF10952, CFIUS Reform Under FIRRMA, by James K. Jackson and Cathleen D. Cimino-Isaacs. 122 For the U.S. Treasury’s summary and FAQs of the changes, see https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/international/the-committee-on-foreign-investment-in-the-united-states-cfius. The Defense Production Act of 1950 Congressional Research Service 19 or takeover of a U.S. firm by a foreign investor, the CFIUS process can proceed potentially through three steps: (1) a 45-day national security review; (2) a 45-day maximum national security investigation (with an option for a 15-day extension for “extraordinary circumstances”); and (3) a 15-day maximum Presidential determination. The President can exercise his authority to suspend or prohibit a foreign investment, subject to a CFIUS review, if he finds that (1) “credible evidence” exists that the foreign investor might take action that threatens to impair the national security; and (2) no other laws provide adequate and appropriate authority for the President to protect national security. FIRRMA shifts the filing requirement for foreign investors from voluntary to mandatory in certain cases, and provides a two-track method for reviewing certain investment transactions. Other changes mandated by FIRRMA would provide more resources for CFIUS, add new reporting requirements, and reform export controls. Termination of the Act Title VII of the DPA also includes a “sunset” clause for the majority of the DPA authorities. All DPA authorities in Titles I, III, and VII have a termination date, with the exception of four sections.123 As explained in Section 717 of the DPA, the sections that are exempt from termination are  50 U.S.C. §4514, Section 104 of the DPA that prohibits both the imposition of wage or price controls without prior congressional authorization and the mandatory compliance of any private person to assist in the production of chemical or biological warfare capabilities;  50 U.S.C. §4557, Section 707 of the DPA that grants persons limited immunity from liability for complying with DPA-authorized regulations;  50 U.S.C. §4558, Section 708 of the DPA that provides for the establishment of voluntary agreements; and  50 U.S.C. §4565, Section 721 of the DPA, the so-called Exon-Florio Amendment, that gives the President and CFIUS review authority over certain corporate acquisition activities. P.L. 115-232 extended the termination date of Section 717 from September 30, 2019, to September 30, 2025. In addition, Section 717(c) provides that any termination of sections of the DPA “shall not affect the disbursement of funds under, or the carrying out of, any contract, guarantee, commitment or other obligation entered into pursuant to this Act” prior to its termination. This means, for instance, that prioritized contracts or Section 303 projects created with DPA authorities prior to September 30, 2025, would still be executed until completion even if the DPA is not reauthorized. Similarly, the statute specifies that the authority to investigate, subpoena, and otherwise collect information necessary to administer the provisions of the act, as provided by Section 705 of the DPA, will not expire until two years after the termination of the DPA.124 For a chronology of all laws reauthorizing the DPA since inception, see Table A-4. Defense Production Act Committee The Defense Production Act Committee (DPAC) is an interagency body originally established by the 2009 reauthorization of the DPA.125 Originally, the DPAC was created to advise the President 123 123 Stat. 2006; 50 U.S.C. §4564. 124 50 U.S.C. §4555(a); Section 705(a) of the DPA. Thus, under current law, Section 705 authority would expire on September 30, 2027. 125 P.L. 111-67, 123 Stat. 2019-2020. The DPAC is now authorized in Section 722 of the DPA, 50 U.S.C. §4567. The Defense Production Act of 1950 Congressional Research Service 20 on the effective use of the full scope of authorities of the DPA. Now, the law requires DPAC to be centrally focused on the priorities and allocations authorities of Title I of the DPA. The statute assigns membership in the DPAC to the head of each federal agency delegated DPA authorities, as well as the Chairperson of the Council of Economic Advisors. A full list of the members of the DPAC is included in E.O. 13603.126 As stipulated in law, the Chairperson of the DPAC is to be the “head of the agency to which the President has delegated primary responsibility for government-wide coordination of the authorities in this Act.”127 As currently established in E.O. 13603 delegations, the Secretary of Homeland Security is the chair-designate, but the language of the law could allow the President to appoint another Secretary with revision to the E.O.128 The Chairperson of the DPAC is also required to appoint one full-time employee of the federal government to coordinate all the activities of the DPAC. Congress has exempted the DPAC from the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.129 The DPAC has annual reporting requirements relating to the Title I priority and allocation authority, and is also required to include updated copies of Title I-related rules in its report. The annual report also contains, among other items, a “description of the contingency planning ... for events that might require the use of the priorities and allocations authorities” and “recommendations for legislative actions, as appropriate, to support the effective use” of the Title I authorities.130 The DPAC report is provided to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the House Committee on Financial Services. Impact of Offsets Report Offsets are industrial compensation practices that foreign governments or companies require of U.S. firms as a condition of purchase in either government-to-government or commercial sales of defense articles and/or defense services as defined by the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. §2751, et seq.) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 C.F.R. §§120-130). In the defense trade, such industrial compensation can include mandatory co-production, licensed production, subcontractor production, technology transfer, and foreign investment. The Secretary of Commerce is required by law to prepare and to transmit to the appropriate congressional committees an annual report on the impact of offsets on defense preparedness, industrial competitiveness, employment, and trade. Specifically, the report discusses “offsets” in the government or commercial sales of defense materials.131 126 Section 701 of E.O. 13603. The DPAC is composed of the Secretaries of Agriculture; Commerce; Defense; Energy; Labor; Health and Human Services; Homeland Security; Interior; Transportation; Treasury, and State; the Attorney General; the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the Administrator of General Services; the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers; and the Directors of the Central Intelligence Agency and of National Intelligence. In addition, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy serve in an advisory role. 127 See Section 722(b)(2) of the DPA; 50 U.S.C. §4567(b)(2). 128 See Section 104(b)(2) of E.O. 13603, which includes as one of the responsibilities of the Secretary of Homeland Security to “provide for the central coordination of the plans and programs incident to authorities and functions delegated under this order.... ” Given this language, the Secretary of Homeland Security is the Chairperson, though a change to E.O. 13603 (or a different interpretation of E.O. 13603 by the Administration), could allow for another Chairperson to be designated. 129 Section 722(e) of the DPA; 50 U.S.C. §4567(e). For more on the Federal Advisory Committee Act, see CRS Report R44253, Federal Advisory Committees: An Introduction and Overview, by Meghan M. Stuessy. 130 See Section 722(d) of the DPA; 50 U.S.C. §4567(d). 131 Offsets are defined in Section 801(k) of E.O. 13603. Offsets can be direct, where offsetting sales of goods and The Defense Production Act of 1950 Congressional Research Service 21 Considerations for Congress Enhance Oversight Expand Reporting or Notification Requirements Congress may consider whether to add more extensive notification and reporting requirements on the use of all or specific authorities in the DPA. These reporting or notification requirements could be added to the existing law, or could be included in conference or committee reports accompanying germane legislation, such as appropriations bills or the National Defense Authorization Act. Additional reporting or notification requirements could involve formal notification of Congress prior to or after the use of certain authorities under specific circumstances. For example, Congress may consider whether to require the President to notify Congress (or the oversight committees) when the priorities and allocations authority is used on a contract valued above a threshold dollar amount.132 Congress might also consider expanding the existing reporting requirements of the DPAC, to include semi-annual updates on the recent use of authorities or explanations about controversial determinations made by the President. Existing requirements could also be expanded from notifying/reporting to the committees of jurisdiction to the Congress as a whole, or to include other interested committees, such as the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. Enforce and Revise Rulemaking Requirements Congress may consider reviewing the agencies’ compliance with existing rulemaking requirements. A rulemaking requirement exists for the voluntary agreement authority in Title VII that has been completed by DHS, but it has not been updated since 1981 and may be in need of an update given changes to the authority and government reorganizations since that date.133 One of the agencies responsible for issuing a rulemaking on the use of Title I authorities has yet to do so. Congress may also consider potentially expanding regulatory requirements for other authorities included in the DPA. For example, Congress may consider whether the President should promulgate rules establishing standards and procedures for the use of all or certain Title III authorities. In addition to formalizing the executive branch’s policies and procedures for using DPA authorities, these regulations could also serve an important function by offering an opportunity for private citizens and industry to comment on and understand the impact of DPA authorities on their personal interests. Broaden Committee Oversight Jurisdiction Since its enactment, the House Committee on Financial Services, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, and their predecessors have exercised legislative oversight services are related to the military export sale being contracted, or indirect, where they are not. These reports are prepared by the Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) and are posted on at BIS’s website at http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/offsets-in-defense-trade. 132 For example, such a notification requirement is placed on Title III projects based on total project cost. See the section “Purchase, Purchase Commitments, and Installation of Equipment” of this report for more. 133 50 U.S.C. §4558(e); Section 708(e) of the DPA. This rule is established in 44 C.F.R. Part 332. The voluntary agreement authority was revised most recently in P.L. 111-67. The national defense context and potential need for voluntary agreement authorities has evolved since 1981, which could also potentially prompt the need to revise the regulation. The Defense Production Act of 1950 Congressional Research Service 22 of the Defense Production Act. The statutory authorities granted in the various titles have been vested in the President, who has delegated some of these authorities to various agency officials through E.O. 13603. As an example of the scope of delegations, the membership of the Defense Production Act Committee (DPAC), created in 2009 and amended in 2014, includes the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Labor, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, the Interior, Transportation, the Treasury, and State; the Attorney General; the Administrators of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and of General Services, the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers; and the Directors of the Central Intelligence Agency and National Intelligence. In order to complement existing oversight, given the number of agencies that currently use or could potentially use the array of DPA authorities to support national defense missions, Congress may consider reestablishing a select committee with a purpose similar to the former Joint Committee on Defense Production.134 As an alternative to the creation of a new committee, Congress may consider formally broadening DPA oversight responsibilities to include all relevant standing committees when developing its committee oversight plan. Should DPA oversight be broadened, Congress might consider ways to enhance inter-committee communication and coordination of its related activities. This coordination could include periodic meetings to prepare for oversight hearings or ensuring that DPA-related communications from agencies are shared appropriately. Finally, because the DPA was enacted at a time when the organization and rules of both chambers were markedly different to current practice, Congress may consider the joint referral of proposed DPA-related legislation to the appropriate oversight committees. Amending the Defense Production Act of 1950 While the act in its current form may remain in force until September 30, 2025, the legislature could amend the DPA at any time to extend, expand, restrict, or otherwise clarify the powers it grants to the President. For example, Congress could eliminate certain authorities altogether. Likewise, Congress could expand the DPA to include new authorities to address novel threats to the national defense. For example, Congress may consider creating new authorities to address specific concerns relating to production and security of emerging technologies necessary for the national defense. Declaration of Policy The “Declaration of Policy” in the DPA describes the general intentions of Congress in granting the authorities conferred on the President. Congress may amend this section of the statute in order to expand, restrict, or clarify the overall purpose of the authorities. For instance, given the wide variety of circumstances in which DPA authorities have been employed, Congress could include an expanded discussion of the specific conditions in which it would find DPA authorities appropriate for use by the President. Though this section serves as a guide for the overall use of DPA authorities, changes to the Declaration of Policy may not fully endow or deny the President’s authorities covered in the titles of the DPA without also amending the DPA’s other provisions. 134 P.L. 102-558, 106 Stat. 4219. This committee was intended to review the programs established by the DPA and advise the standing committees in their legislation on the subject. The Defense Production Act of 1950 Congressional Research Service 23 Definitions Congress may amend the definitions of key terms found in the DPA to shape the scope and use of the authorities, especially the definition of national defense. As an example, Congress could amend the definition of national defense to remove space from the definition, thus weakening the President’s ability to support space-related projects through the use of DPA authorities.135 On the other hand, for example, Congress could amend the definition of national defense to specifically include counter-narcotics, cybersecurity, or organized crime. Doing so would more explicitly enable the use of DPA authorities to address these homeland security and national defense concerns. Amending the Delegations of Authority in E.O. 13603 Congress may consider limiting the use of certain DPA authorities to specific agencies. To do so, Congress could amend the President’s delegation of DPA authorities, superseding those made in E.O. 13603, by amending the statute to assign specific authorities to individual Cabinet Secretaries rather than the President. Further, Congress could expand the use of the legislative clause “on a nondelegable basis” to ensure that the authority is not delegated beyond the person identified in the statute.136 In considering these options, Congress may determine that the use of some authorities by certain agencies is appropriate and necessary for the national defense, but not for others. Appropriations to the DPA Fund Congress could adjust future appropriations to the DPA Fund in order to manage the scope of Title III projects initiated by the President (see Table 1 for appropriations to the DPA Fund since FY2010). The use of the DPA Fund, however, is specific to Title III. Therefore, adjusting appropriations to the DPA Fund is unlikely to have an effect on the President’s ability to exercise authorities under the other titles of the DPA, unless Congress drafts legislation changing the nature of the Fund itself or authorizing its use beyond a specific title. Congress may also reintroduce a separate provision in Section 711 of the DPA authorizing only certain appropriation amounts over a given time period for Title III or other DPA authorities.137 Likewise, Congress may direct the use of such funds more specifically, such as has been done in relation to past Title III projects.138 Congress may also consider including specific restrictions or reporting requirements related to the DPA in the appropriations made to other accounts that could be used to pay for Title I activities, such as the Disaster Relief Fund managed by FEMA.139 135 For the definition of national defense, see 50 U.S.C. §4552(14); Section 702(14) of the DPA. 136 For an example of this clause, see 50 U.S.C. §4558(c)(3); Section 708(c)(3) of the DPA. 137 For example, appropriations for Title I could be authorized for only one year, but for Title III for five, and vice versa. See the “Authorization of Appropriations” section of this report for more. 138 For example, see Section 315, P.L. 112-239, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013. This provision limited the use of funds for a Title III project on biofuels production. 139 The Disaster Relief Fund is the main account to fund a wide variety of federal disaster assistance programs and activities pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (P.L. 93-288). As such, it has been used to pay for priority-rated contracts to support disaster relief efforts.

Notes: This table does not include all laws that amended the DPA, only those that altered the termination date of the act, currently codified at 50 U.S.C. §4564, Section 717 of the DPA. a. Not all provisions of the DPA may have expired on each given date, as the law has frequently offered an evolving set of exceptions to the termination of DPA authorities. For example, currently the majority of DPA authorities will terminate on September 30, 2025, with the exception of four sections. b. P.L. 83-95 permitted the termination of Titles 2 and 6 as of June 30, 1953, and Titles IV and V to terminate as of April 30, 1953. c. The termination of authorization from October 20, 1990, to August 17, 1991, is the longest period on record since inception. However, in Section 7 of P.L. 102-99, Congress set the effective date of the passage to October 20, 1990, thus technically authorizing the DPA through this time period. Author Information Michael H.
