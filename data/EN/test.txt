RU2618599C2,Method of estimating full profile of vertical distribution of sound speed," FIELD: measuring equipment. SUBSTANCE: invention may be used to form a complete profile of the vertical distribution of the sound speed (VDSS) in water from the surface to the bottom. Essence: to make measurements of the hydrophysical parameters of the aquatic environment of naval equipment, placed on a surface ship, submarine and unmanned underwater vehicles, and form a fragment of the curve of the vertical distribution of sound speed, which does not characterize the sound speed field in the surface and bottom layers of the sea. Using a set of probability curves VDSS of scale climatic region of the production of hydro-physical parameters measurements for the current season is calculated by the average value of the sound velocity at the sea surface and the region of possible location of the underwater sound channel with weighted average values of the speed of sound at standard horizons. Analyzing the minimum and maximum depth of measurement points measured fragment the speed of sound and calculated parameters of the field of possible location of the underwater sound channel, finish building the measured fragment VDSS to the surface using the speed of sound parameters at the sea surface and bottom using the weighted average speed of sound at standard horizons and depth gradients. EFFECT: increasing the accuracy of the solution of practical problems, requiring the presence of a complete profile VDSS, by increasing the reliability of the digital model of the channel of distribution of the acoustic energy in the aquatic environment. 2 dwg  "
